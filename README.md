Digital Systems Design - Access terminal

An access terminal is a simple electronic device that allows authorized users to access protected objects. It usually consists of a keyboard, LCD display and control unit. Before entering the object, each user must type in the activation code on the keypad of the access terminal and, based on it, will gain or not gain access to the object. 

The aim of this project is to implement such an access terminal on the FITKit device, where there is a keyboard, LCD display and FPGA gate array connected to both of these peripherals. The task of the FPGA chip is to monitor the keyboard inputs, evaluate the entered access code and display the appropriate responses on the LCD display.
